warranty
========

Apple warranty estimation script.

This script estimates whether a given serial number is under warranty.
Input can be one or more given serial numbers, or a text file listing serials.
Output can be standard out or a CSV file.

All of the good ideas herein came from [glarizza][1], except for the rest of the good ideas which came from [pudquick][2]. Every terrible idea is my own.
